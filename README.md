## Envite

Envite is a web application that aims to help people organise meet-ups between friends in a hassle-free manner. It aims to supplant the current practice of using Facebook events or instant messaging, which we feel is insufficient and slow.

The proposed level of difficulty is Apollo 11 with Mentorship, or Apollo 11 if without.

## Planned features

![User stories](http://i.imgur.com/vwO0WNR.png "User Stories")

> This is a list of user stories that we have come up with. 

In the first column of **must haves**, we have decided that the bare minimum a user is able to do is to create an event and to invite his friends. His invited friends would also be able to vote on the venue and time chosen, and to suggest alternatives for others to vote on as well.

> List of events that the user has been invited to. Events will be presented in a "card" form, so it is clear to the user.

For the development of the application, Chunqi will be serving as the technical lead, and be in charge of most of the technology stack that is used. Ming Xuan will be serving as a front-end developer, taking charge of user interface and design. 
## Milestones

By Milestone 1, we aim to have a somewhat working prototype of our project. A demo of the app can be reached [here](http://young-plains-4770.herokuapp.com).

By Milestone 2, we hope that the UI can be much more polished and that the app would offer a better user experience. We also hope to integrate the Facebook login so that users would not need to register for another account on our platform.

By Milestone 3, we hope to have carried out some usability tests to gather feedback on how to better improve the user experience.
